1- Create a numpy array of shape (3, 4) and assign random integers between 1 and 10 to every element.

2- Find the maximum value in the array created in step 1.

3- Calculate the mean value of each row in the array.

4- Reshape the array from step 1 into a shape of (2, 6).

5- Multiply each element in the array by 2.

6- Create a numpy array with values ranging from 0 to 9. Extract the odd numbers from the array.

7- Create a 3x3 identity matrix using numpy.

8- Create a 5x5 array with random values and normalize it (subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation of the array).

9- Perform element-wise multiplication between two arrays of the same shape.

10 - Given an array of heights in centimeters, convert them to inches (1 inch = 2.54 cm).

11 - Create a 1D array of numbers from 0 to 9. Replace all odd numbers with -1.

12 - Create a 2D array with random values and find the indices of the maximum and minimum values.
